The solution should require as little overhead as possible.\nWell Architected Framework The goal was to design a solution specific to this use-case but also flexible enough to evolve over time. Additionally, the solution must follow all of the well architected framework pillars:\n Operational Excellence. The solution must do what it is supposed to do. Security. The solution should secure data at rest and transit. Only authorized people can see and interact with the data. Reliability. The solution must be fault tolerant and auto-scaling. Performance Efficiency. The solution must be fast. Cost Optimization. The solution\u0026rsquo;s value should far exceed the solution\u0026rsquo;s costs.
