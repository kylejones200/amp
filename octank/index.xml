      <description>This is a cost estimate for implentation and ongoing costs for one Offshore facility. Costs are estimated in US dollars for the US-East-1 region. The estimates do not include fees, taxes, or Octank Enterprise Discounts. The actual costs depend on a variety of factors, including the project scope and actual usage of AWS services.

      <description>The solution is the start of a journey. It is designed to be extendible without creating Technical Debt.
Specifically, it is designed to:
 Ingest additional data sources Support additional presentation layers Integrate current and future AI/ML models  Amazon Alexa An example of the extendibility would be adding a voice interface so that Martin could get updates and ask questions in real time.</description>
